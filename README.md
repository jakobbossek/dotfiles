dotfiles
========

This is a (incomplete) collection of my dotfiles which I currently use on my OS X system. Simply clone this repository, 
make the bootstrap file executable and run it. This will generate symbolic links to the dotfiles in the repository to their corresponding locations in the file system.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jakobbossek/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap
./bootstrap
```
